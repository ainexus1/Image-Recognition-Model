# Image-Recognition-Model
---
**Description:**

This repository contains an image recognition model that I developed to classify images into various categories. The model is built using machine learning and is capable of accurately identifying and categorizing objects and scenes in images.

**Key Features:**

- State-of-the-art image classification.
- Pre-trained models for quick implementation.
- Easy-to-follow codebase for training custom models.

**Usage:**

You can use this model for various applications, including:

- Automated image tagging.
- Content moderation.
- Object detection.

**Getting Started:**

To get started with this image recognition model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Explore the Jupyter notebooks or VS Code for model training and evaluation.
4. Use the pre-trained models for image recognition tasks.
5. Customize the model as per your specific requirements.

**Contributing:**

We welcome contributions from the open-source community to enhance this image recognition model. If you have any ideas, bug fixes, or improvements, please submit a pull request, and we'll be happy to review it.
